# Todo Challenge

This application was built to gain some experience of using AngularJS in a test driven environment.  It aims to address the following user stories:

```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice
```

Future functionality might address the following user stories:

```
As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:


### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

I also use a number of node.js tools to initialize. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


### Clone ReadingList
Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/timhyson/todo_challenge.git
cd todo_challenge
```


### Run the Application

The project is preconfigured to run with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.


## Current project status

Still in development.  I only want to add features when I can first write failing tests, and that's proving challenging but I intend to keep revisiting it.
